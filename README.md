## This is an experiment and as such is completely unsupported

Testing:

1. Clone this repo
2. Change into the repo
3. Init the submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive` (the recursive is important since there is one nested submodule)
4. run the example: `cargo run --example window` (currently this example doesn't do anything, not even displaying a window)
